CWServerWrapper
===============
Author: Aahz (http://cubeworldforum.org/user/38832-aahz/) (steamID: aahz07)

Basic and simple server wrapper for Cube World (https://picroma.com/cubeworld).

Notes:
- Remember, you need to add some necessary files to Debug/Release in order to run properly:
    - Found in the Cube World folder:
        + Server.exe
        + server.cfg
        + msvcp110.dll
        + msvcr110.dll
        + zlib1.dll
        + data1.db
        + data2.db
        + data3.db
        + data4.db
    - Pulled from LUDIJAK's code (http://cubeworldforum.org/user/34606-ludijak/):
        + ServerFix.dll
        + settings.ini

- I was originally just doing this to get a quick server wrapper with a GUI going, so I could
    have it for my own personal use and for friends. It took a quick afternoon of caffeine and
    sugar, and countless frustrating breaks of playing on a friend's crashy CW server. As a
    result, this is definitely not production quality code. This is unashamed, sloppy code.
        Enjoy :)
